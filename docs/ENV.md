# Environment variables

`backend/src/config.ts` is the runtime authority. [`.env.template`](../.env.template) is the copyable local-development template; Railway variables are the production source of truth. Never commit a populated `.env` file.

## Core runtime

| Variable | Requirement | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Required | Railway PostgreSQL connection string |
| `DATABASE_REPLICA_URL` | Optional | Read-only replica connection string |
| `PORT` | Optional | API port; Railway supplies this in production |
| `WORKER_PORT` | Optional | Separate worker health port |
| `NODE_ENV` | Required in production | Use `production` on Railway |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Required in production | Comma-separated HTTPS website origins; wildcards are rejected |

## Authentication, payments, and queues

| Variables | Requirement |
|---|---|
| `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`, `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`, `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` | Required for authenticated production traffic |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Required for payments; webhook secrets must differ |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` | Required for distributed cache and rate limits |
| `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL` or `REDIS_URL` | Required for BullMQ workers |
| `QUEUE_HMAC_SECRET` | Required for signed queue payloads |

## Encryption

Use independent secrets; never reuse one key for multiple fields.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `TASK_LOCATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Base64-encoded 32-byte key for precise task locations |
| `TASK_LOCATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY_ID` | Stable identifier for the active location key |
| `TASK_LOCATION_DECRYPTION_KEYS` | JSON map of retired key IDs to base64 keys during rotation |
| `TAX_TIN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encrypt tax identifiers |
| `SESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Encrypt server-side session material |

Generate TIN/session keys with `openssl rand -hex 32` and location keys with `openssl rand -base64 32`. Follow validation errors for exact formats.

## Optional integrations

The template groups optional variables for object storage, maps, AI providers, Twilio, SendGrid, Sentry, feature flags, and operator-only certification tooling. Configure only integrations that are enabled. AWS credentials used by Rekognition or S3-compatible storage are service credentials; they do not imply AWS hosts the backend.

Database pool tuning is available through `DB_POOL_MAX`, `DB_REPLICA_POOL_MAX`, `DB_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS`, `DB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS`, and `DB_STATEMENT_TIMEOUT_MS`.
