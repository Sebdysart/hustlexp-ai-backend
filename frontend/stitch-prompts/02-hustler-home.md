### Design Notes

**Why this matters:**
- First screen hustlers see
- Sets tone for entire app
- Makes trust tier visible and aspirational
- Shows system is serious, not casual

**Visual Authority:**
- Large XP ring = gamification without noise
- Trust tier badge = earned status, not requested
- Earnings prominent = money is the point
- Instant Mode status = system is active

**Trust Signals:**
- Clean, Apple-like design
- No clutter or distractions
- Stats are factual, not inflated
- System is in control (Instant Mode ON, not optional)
