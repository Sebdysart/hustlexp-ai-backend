# HustleXP Stitch Prompts

This directory contains ready-to-use prompts for generating high-fidelity UI screens in Google Stitch.

## Purpose

These prompts generate **static, high-fidelity, non-interactive screens** that lock:
- Visual authority
- Hierarchy
- Emotional weight
- Trust signaling

**This is the visual constitution of HustleXP.**

## Screen Order (Priority)

1. **01-instant-interrupt-card.md** — CRITICAL (most important UI)
2. **02-hustler-home.md** — First screen hustlers see
3. **03-pinned-instant-card.md** — Post-dismiss fallback
4. **04-poster-task-creation.md** — AI-assisted task creation
5. **05-poster-hustler-on-way.md** — DoorDash moment
6. **06-trust-tier-ladder.md** — Safety visibility
7. **07-xp-breakdown.md** — Reward transparency
8. **08-dispute-protection.md** — Trust enforcement

## How to Use

1. Open Google Stitch (or your preferred UI generation tool)
2. Copy the prompt from the markdown file
3. Paste into Stitch
4. Generate the screen
5. Review against MAX-tier standards:
   - Authority > Fun
   - Gamification is directional, not noisy
   - System is in control

## Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

### 1. Authority > Fun
- Glass surfaces
- Strong spacing
- Minimal clutter
- Calm confidence

### 2. Gamification Is Directional, Not Noisy
- XP rings
- Badges
- Timers
- "First to accept" cues
- **Never arcade chaos**

### 3. System Is in Control
- UI *tells* users what is happening
- No choice overload
- No safety decisions left to posters

## What Happens After Stitch

1. **Lock visual decisions** (no redesign loops)
2. **Translate to Figma** (add states + motion)
3. **Wire to backend** (connect to real data)

## Color Palette (Consistent Across All Screens)

- Background: `#000000` (true black)
- Card background: `rgba(28, 28, 30, 0.6)` with blur
- Primary accent: `#34C759` (green for money/accept)
- Urgency accent: `#FF3B30` (red) to `#FF9500` (amber)
- Trust tier: `#007AFF` (blue)
- Text primary: `#FFFFFF`
- Text secondary: `#8E8E93`

## Typography (Consistent Across All Screens)

- Font family: SF Pro Display (system font stack)
- Headings: weight 700-800
- Body: weight 400-500
- Labels: weight 600, uppercase, tracking: 1-2px

## Constraints (All Screens)

- Static UI only. No animations.
- No placeholder charts or fake data beyond what's specified.
- No decorative elements that distract from the action.
- Design for iPhone 15 Pro Max viewport (430×932px).
- Dark mode preferred.

## Next Steps

1. Generate **Screen #1 (Instant Interrupt)** first
2. Get brutal critique before proceeding
3. Then generate **Screen #2 (Hustler Home)**
4. Then **Screen #5 (Hustler on the Way)**
5. Continue with remaining screens

**Do not proceed until Instant Interrupt screen is approved.**
