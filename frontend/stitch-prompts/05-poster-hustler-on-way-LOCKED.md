# Screen 5: Poster "Hustler on the Way" Screen — LOCKED
## Status: APPROVED — Final Authority Review Passed

**Verdict:** This screen delivers relief, certainty, and momentum. It will lower cancellation rates, reduce poster anxiety, increase repeat usage, and reinforce trust tiers implicitly. This is the DoorDash moment.

**What Works at MAX Tier:**
- ✅ Emotional targeting (relief, certainty, momentum)
- ✅ Abstract avatar (geometric, not photo — avoids uncanny valley, bias, false intimacy)
- ✅ Trust visibility without overexposure (tier badge, stats, rating — present but not screaming)
- ✅ Progress steps card (system-in-control moment, removes anxiety)
- ✅ ETA framing (transparent but non-technical)

**Required Refinements Applied:**
- ✅ "Message Hustler" → "Contact via HustleXP" (reinforces system mediation, reduces poster anxiety)
- ✅ Hustler name de-emphasized (18px, opacity: 0.9 — system state is hero, not individual)
- ✅ Trust tier label: "TIER B" → "Trusted (Tier B)" (human-readable with system transparency)
- ✅ System assurance line added: "HustleXP monitors this task end-to-end" (12px, secondary text — reinforces accountability)

**This screen is LOCKED (v1). Do not iterate further.**
