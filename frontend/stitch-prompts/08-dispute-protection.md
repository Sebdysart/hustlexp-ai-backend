### Design Notes

**Why this matters:**
- Makes trust visible (escrow protected)
- Shows enforcement (zero tolerance)
- Reduces anxiety (what happens if something goes wrong)
- Makes system feel final and authoritative

**Visual Authority:**
- Shield icon = protection
- Escrow status = money is safe
- Zero tolerance = system is serious
- Calm tone = not fear-mongering

**Trust Signals:**
- Escrow protected badge
- Clear dispute process
- 24-hour resolution promise
- Zero tolerance messaging (but calm, not aggressive)
