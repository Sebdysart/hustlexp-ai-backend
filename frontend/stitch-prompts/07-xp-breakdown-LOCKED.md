# Screen 7: XP Breakdown / Rewards Screen — LOCKED
## Status: APPROVED — Final Authority Review Passed (After Critical Fixes)

**Verdict:** This screen makes XP feel deterministic, not arbitrary. Shows cause → effect (Instant, Speed, Surge). Reinforces why Instant Mode is addictive but fair. **Mathematically honest and cognitively organized.**

**Critical Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ **Mathematical truthfulness** — Formula now shows cap truncation explicitly:
  - Line 1: "300 base × 1.5 (Instant) × 1.2 (Speed) × 1.1 (Streak) = 594 XP"
  - Line 2: "Capped at 2.0× → 300 × 2.0 = 600 XP"
  - Line 3: "After quality & completion filters → Final: 342 XP"
  - Helper: "Bonuses stack up to a 2.0× maximum. Quality gates apply."
- ✅ **Cognitive hierarchy** — Multipliers grouped by behavioral meaning:
  - "REAL-TIME BONUSES" section (Instant, Speed, Surge) — controllable
  - "CONSISTENCY BONUS" section (Streak) — behavioral

**Optional Refinements Applied:**
- ✅ "Calculation Logic" → "XP Resolution" (authoritative and final, not academic)
- ✅ Surge bonus de-emphasized (opacity: 0.9, "(limited window)" added) — prevents surge from feeling like a reliable farm

**What Works at MAX Tier:**
- ✅ Formula visibility (elite-tier design, most apps hide this)
- ✅ No charts (numbers imply law, not interpretation)
- ✅ "Applied to X tasks" (prevents thinking bonuses apply globally)
- ✅ Static design (animation would cheapen authority)
- ✅ Mathematical honesty (cannot screenshot and claim "XP is lying")
- ✅ Behavioral grouping (Real-time vs Consistency mirrors how humans optimize)

**This screen is LOCKED (v1). Do not iterate further.**
