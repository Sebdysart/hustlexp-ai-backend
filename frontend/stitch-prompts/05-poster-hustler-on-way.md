### Design Notes

**Why this matters:**
- This is the DoorDash moment (relief, certainty)
- Makes trust visible (tier badge, stats)
- Shows momentum (progress steps)
- Reduces anxiety (ETA, escrow protected)

**Visual Authority:**
- Large avatar = human connection (abstract, not creepy)
- Trust tier badge = earned status ("Trusted" human-readable, "Tier B" system-transparent)
- Progress steps = system is working
- ETA = transparency
- System assurance line = accountability and institutional presence
- Contact button = system-mediated, not direct obligation

**Trust Signals:**
- Abstract avatar (not creepy, not fake)
- Stats visible (47 tasks, 4.9★)
- Escrow protected badge
- System is in control (progress steps)
- "HustleXP monitors this task end-to-end" = traceability
- "Contact via HustleXP" = system mediation, not direct obligation
- Hustler name de-emphasized = system state is hero, not individual
