# Screen 6: Trust Tier Ladder Screen — LOCKED
## Status: APPROVED — Final Authority Review Passed

**Verdict:** This screen prevents bad actors from even wanting to proceed, makes trust progression feel slow/serious/legitimate, aligns perfectly with backend trust-tier state machine, and reinforces "system decides" without explanation walls. This is not a profile screen—this is a **permission system**.

**What Works at MAX Tier:**
- ✅ "Earned, not requested" (top copy) — reframes trust as irreversible, non-negotiable, not customer-service-driven
- ✅ Vertical hierarchy (top → bottom) — teaches ladder without instructions, makes cheating feel pointless
- ✅ Color encoding = authority (blue = verified/current, gold = aspirational/next, greyed = inaccessible/locked)
- ✅ No "Apply" buttons — enforces entire safety philosophy (no CTA to request access, no upgrade now, no paid shortcut)
- ✅ Metrics at bottom (not top) — XP/tasks/rating are context, not identity (prevents stat-chasing, vanity optimization)

**Optional Refinements Applied:**
- ✅ Tier naming consistency — Names carry meaning (primary), letters are secondary (system transparency)
- ✅ Non-interactive explanation added — "Requirements are evaluated automatically" (12px, secondary text, below progress) — preempts support questions without opening debate

**This screen is LOCKED (v1). Do not iterate further.**
