# Screen 1: Instant Interrupt Card (Hustler View) — LOCKED
## Status: APPROVED — Final Authority Review Passed

**Verdict:** This screen now feels inevitable, not optional. Matches backend authority model. Screenshot-worthy and demo-ready. Would materially increase Instant accept rates.

**Refinements Applied:**
- ✅ 12px extra spacing between XP pill and task title (clean cognitive transition)
- ✅ Timer de-emphasized (#F2F2F7, 90% opacity) to not compete with task title
- ✅ Skip button made subordinate (15px, 85% opacity) to prevent accidental dismissals

**This screen is LOCKED. Do not iterate further.**
