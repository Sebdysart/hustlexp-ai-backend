# Screen 2: Hustler Home (MAX Tier Dashboard) — LOCKED
## Status: APPROVED — Final Authority Review Passed

**Verdict:** This screen establishes identity, reinforces status, delivers immediate reward clarity, frames Instant Mode as a professional state, and makes progress inevitable. This is not a gig app dashboard—this is a **command center**.

**What Works at MAX Tier:**
- ✅ XP Ring + Trust Tier pairing (institutional, not gamey)
- ✅ Today's Snapshot card (perfect restraint, one number that matters)
- ✅ Instant Mode as a state, not a feature (going on duty, arming a system)
- ✅ Career Progression framing (showing progress toward access, not dangling rewards)
- ✅ No feed, no noise, no begging (avoids task cards, notifications, promos)

**Optional Refinements Applied:**
- ✅ "WELCOME BACK" visual weight reduced (opacity: 0.7, font-weight: 500) — lets XP ring be the hero
- ✅ Bottom nav contrast tightened (icon opacity increased by ~6%) — keeps central "+" action dominant

**This screen is LOCKED (v1). Do not iterate further.**
