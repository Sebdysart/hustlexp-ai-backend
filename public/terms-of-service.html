    <!-- 4 -->
    <h2>4. How HustleXP Works</h2>
    <h3>4.1 The Platform</h3>
    <p>
      HustleXP is a marketplace that connects people who need local tasks done ("Task Posters") with people who want to complete those tasks ("Hustlers"). We provide the platform &mdash; <strong>we are not a party to any agreement between Task Posters and Hustlers</strong>.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Posting Tasks</h3>
    <p>When posting a task, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide an accurate description of the task, requirements, and location</li>
      <li>Set a fair compensation amount for the work</li>
      <li>Respond to questions and messages from Hustlers in a timely manner</li>
      <li>Only post tasks that are legal and comply with these Terms</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.3 Accepting &amp; Completing Tasks</h3>
    <p>When accepting a task, you agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Complete the task as described within the agreed timeframe</li>
      <li>Communicate promptly if you cannot complete the task</li>
      <li>Perform the work with reasonable care and skill</li>
      <li>Not subcontract or delegate the task to someone else without the Task Poster's consent</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4.4 XP &amp; Ratings</h3>
    <p>
      HustleXP uses a gamified experience system. You earn XP for completing tasks, maintaining good ratings, and other platform activities. Your XP, level, and rating are visible to other users and help build trust on the platform.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ratings should be honest and reflect your genuine experience</li>
      <li>Manipulating ratings (fake reviews, retaliatory ratings, review trading) is prohibited</li>
      <li>We reserve the right to remove ratings that violate these Terms</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 5 -->
    <h2>5. Payments</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Payment Processing</h3>
    <p>
      All payments on HustleXP are processed through <strong>Stripe</strong>. By using our payment features, you also agree to <a href="https://stripe.com/legal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stripe's Terms of Service</a>. We do not store your credit card numbers or bank account details on our servers.
    </p>

    <h3>5.2 Task Payments</h3>
    <p>When a Hustler accepts a task:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Task Poster's payment is authorized and held securely</li>
      <li>Upon successful completion and confirmation, the payment is released to the Hustler</li>
      <li>If a task is canceled before completion, the payment is refunded to the Task Poster (minus any applicable fees)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Platform Fees</h3>
    <p>
      HustleXP charges a service fee on completed tasks. The fee structure will be clearly displayed before you confirm any transaction. We reserve the right to change our fee structure with advance notice to users.
    </p>

    <h3>5.4 Refunds &amp; Disputes</h3>
    <p>
      If a task is not completed to the description provided, either party may initiate a dispute through the App. We will review disputes on a case-by-case basis and make a determination at our reasonable discretion. Our dispute resolution decisions are final.
    </p>

    <h3>5.5 Taxes</h3>
    <p>
      You are solely responsible for determining and paying any taxes that apply to payments you receive through HustleXP. We may provide tax-related forms (such as 1099s) as required by law, but we do not provide tax advice.
    </p>

    <!-- 6 -->
